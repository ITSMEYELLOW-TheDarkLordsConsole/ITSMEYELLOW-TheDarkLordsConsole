## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a student, learning how to code! I'm fairly new to GitHub, so I don't know how everything works quite yet. You might recognize my username if you're a fan of Animator vs Animation like I am. (I'm not really a yellow stick figure, although that would be cool.) Currently, I'm not working on much here, but I'm interested in learning more about coding. My pronouns are she/they.
